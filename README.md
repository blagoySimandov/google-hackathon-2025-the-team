## Overview
Repositry for the Google Irealand BGN 2025 Hackathon holding the project "ReviveMap".
Revive Map is a website showcasing Irish derelict buildings and computing how viabile would be to invest in them, both from a personal financial standpoint and 
as a community.

It takes into account:
 - Community Score - How valueable would this building be for the community ? Can it be turned into a hospital, or maye a police station ? How close is it to the community ?
 - Valiability Score - How valiable would it be to refurbish this building ? Is the price of refurbishment low enough to make the investment sound ?
 - Sustainability Score - What are the CO2 savings if we do refurbish the building instead of building it anew ?
